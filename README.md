# food-discovery-app

> created __init__.py file with nothing in it. This is to treat the folder food_assistance_api as a package ( as it's python < 3.33 version)

> created static folder for css files, cause that's how it should be for flask applications 

> SQL_Playground.py is just to run DB sql queries

> Ignore the food_assistance.db file outside the food_assistance_api folder
